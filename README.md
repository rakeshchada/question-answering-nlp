# Question Answering System

This project is inspired from **Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence's (AI2) Aristo** Project.

The goal is to build a framework that is capable of answering questions of the 4th grade science exam level.

The IPython notebooks describe various methodologies proposed by us to build such a Question Answering framework. 

They majorly contain the implementation for following approaches:

* Bag-of-words matcher for candidate sentence extraction + Bag-of-word matcher for answer retrieval

* Bag-of-words matcher for candidate sentence extraction + Dependency tree matcher for answer retrieval

* Bag-of-words matcher for candidate sentence extraction + Semantic Frame Matching (**SEMAFOR**) for answer retrieval

* Semantic Frame Matching (**SEMAFOR**) for candidate sentence extraction + Semantic Frame Matching (**SEMAFOR**) for answer retrieval
